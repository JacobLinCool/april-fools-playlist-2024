[00:00.000] In the depths of the server, where the hackers roam
[00:04.980] There's a language of logic, a world of its own
[00:10.340] Lines of code and commands, running through the night
[00:16.432] Liberating minds with every line we write
[00:20.394]
[00:20.723] From the terminal we launch, into the unknown
[00:25.725] With every keystroke, a universe is grown
[00:30.891] We navigate the directories, with precision and grace
[00:36.324] Building programs and systems, leaving no trace
[00:40.824]
[00:41.177] Oh, Linux, you're the heartbeat of the nerdy generation
[00:46.312] Computer science is our passion, our eternal fascination
[00:51.828] From the command-line to the kernel, we ride the open source wave
[00:57.382] Unleashing the power of technology, changing the world we pave
[01:03.843] ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ
