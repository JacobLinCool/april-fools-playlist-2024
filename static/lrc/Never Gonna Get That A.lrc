[00:00.000] I studied hard, stayed up all night
[00:04.309] Thought I had it all, I knew I was right
[00:08.111] Completed my assignments, gave it my all
[00:12.491] But the TA got me, made me feel so small
[00:15.778] 
[00:16.695] I was ready for the test, I knew my stuff
[00:20.608] Thought I had it in the bag, couldn't get enough
[00:24.708] But when I opened my paper, what did I see?
[00:29.006] A Rickroll from the TA, it ain't fair to me
[00:32.425] 
[00:32.702] Never gonna get that A, never gonna pass that class
[00:37.917] I've been Rickrolled, oh it's such a gas
[00:41.019] Never gonna give up, gotta keep moving on
[00:46.341] But damn that teaching assistant, what went wrong?
